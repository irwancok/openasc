1.1.0 -- 11 nov 2012
--------------------
* More efficient implementation of the send_ascii_data function in case
  no formatting is needed. If formatting is needed, use the send_ascii_dataf
  function instead.

* New function send_ascii_data_P to send strings directly from flash.

* Improved ASCII command parser.

* More verbose ASCII command help text.


1.0.3 -- 31 oct 2012
--------------------
* Bugfix: The target heading was cleared by the state machine when setting a
  new heading while the rotator was running. This caused the rotator to run
  until it hit the rotation limit.


1.0.2 -- 28 oct 2012
--------------------
* Fixed a bug in the SK3W rotator and power amp control that caused a
  "bus storm". Both firmwares did not ignore messages sent to the
  broadcast address which caused the two cards to start talking to
  each other in an endless loop :-)


1.0.1 -- 28 oct 2012
--------------------
* Bugfix: The rotation speed calculation was off by a factor of 10
  which triggered the ROTATOR STUCK error.

* Now not releasing the break in calibration mode.

* Increased both TX and RX buffers to 30 entries.


1.0.0 -- 13 oct 2012
--------------------
* Initial revision
