 \begin{Desc}
\item[Overview]This display driver provides an interface to the most common type of character LCD, those based on the HD44780 or SED1278 controller chip (about 90\% of character LCDs use one of these chips).� The display driver can interface to the display through the CPU memory bus, or directly via I/O port pins.� When using the direct I/O port mode, no additional interface hardware is needed except for a contrast potentiometer. �Supported functions include initialization, clearing, scrolling, cursor positioning, text writing, and loading of custom characters or icons (up to 8).� Although these displays are simple, clever use of the custom characters can allow you to create animations or simple graphics.� The \char`\"{}progress bar\char`\"{} function that is included in this driver is an example of graphics using limited custom-chars.\end{Desc}
The driver now supports both 8-bit and 4-bit interface modes.
