All the files have been edited using a tab width of 2. Also some of the code
has been given to me from various sources. All from AVRLIBC fans to various ham radio
ops with programming skills. All the people who have been doing work on this are named
in the software history and also in the file named CREDITS.

If you do changes to the code and wish to include it in the public release then I would 
appriciate if you sent the changes to me by using email (mike@wmv-tech.com). If I like the
changes I will include them into the public release of this software. I can also add support
for your own equipment using the communication protocol so you can enjoy the software
updates without needing to modify everything each time you wish to load a new release.

When reporting bugs and wanted features that does not have source code already made then please 
use the bug reporting tool located on my website (http://www.wmv-tech.com). If you however have
done the source code then please just mail it to me. When doing this please do comment it A LOT
and show exactly where changes have been made and also notes in which files the changes have been
made. I will not accept uncommented code that takes me too long time to realize what has been done.

I also would love if people would help me to complete the manual for my devices. The more help
I get with these kind of things the more time it leaves for me improving all the source code for
the different products in the openASC package.

Enjoy it!
