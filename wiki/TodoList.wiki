#summary This is a list of things that need to be implemented.
#labels Phase-Design

= Todo - software =

== openASC box ==
  * Fix manual band change to work properly
  * Figure out how to implement band decoding in general
  * Implement automatic freq decoding of ICOM
  * Implement automatic freq decoding of KENWOOD
  * Implement automatic freq decoding of YAESU
  * Implement automatic band change from BCD
  * Fix so that the sequencer timings can be configured properly
  * Implement resend etc into the internal communication protocol
  * Evaluate if we should increase time slots in the communication protocol, and maybe also decrease the amount of interrupts generated by the timer handling this. This to make the protocol more robust since we don't have any critical timing issues anymore.
  * Implement the array sub menu
  * Implement the stack sub menu
  * Implement the "inhibit" signals to the driver modules
  * Implement the TX/RX mode
  * Add more available functions to the external keypad
  * Work on rotator support
  * Add option to change resolution of the rotator knob

== Driver modules ==
  * Implement the inhibit signal from the openASC box
  * Implement TX/RX mode ability

== Rotator boards == 
Finish the hardware first...

== PC Configuration software ==
  * Finish the sub menu support
  * Fix so that the sequencer timing sends its settings properly

== PC controller software ==
  * Not planned

== openASC server software by OH0GRY == 
  * Impelement the openASC bus protocol
